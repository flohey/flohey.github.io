I currently work as a fluid mechanics process engineer in the battery and converting sector. 
During my studies in physics, I focused on solid-state physics and nonlinear dynamics. 
My doctoral research centered on fluid dynamics, particularly atmospheric and weather dynamics, as well as machine learning algorithms.
Throughout my time at university, I discovered a passion for teaching and the art of didactics. 
I believe that teaching is a reciprocal process, where I continuously learn and grow while helping others grasp and apply new concepts. 
For this purpose I hope to create some value via the contents of this blog.
