<h3> Who am I and What is This Blog About? </h3>
My name is Florian, and I currently work as a Fluid Mechanics Process Engineer in the battery and converting sector. 
I hold a background in physics, with a focus on solid-state physics and nonlinear dynamics during my studies. 
My doctoral research explored fluid dynamics, specifically atmospheric and weather dynamics, and involved the application of machine learning algorithms.
Throughout my academic journey, I developed a deep passion for teaching and the principles of didactics. 
I view teaching as a reciprocal process, where I continuously learn and evolve while helping others understand and apply complex concepts. 
I am also deeply interested in industrial processes and efficiency, striving to find innovative solutions that improve performance and reduce waste.
Through this blog, I aim to create valuable content that contributes to both my own growth and the learning of others, while reflecting my diverse interests in both academic and industrial applications.
