### Introduction
Why building a ROM in the first place? (Digital twin, etc.)

### Examples for ROMs

#### Proper Orthogonal Decomposition


#### Autoencoder networks



### ROM of a thermal convection flow


### Embedding ROMs into a bigger picture
Combining ROMs & Predictors -> recommenders, digital twins (real-time surveillance of original, compute alternative scenarios, etc.)


### Conclusion and further references
